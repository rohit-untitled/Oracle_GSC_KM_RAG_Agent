This document describes the functional design of the list of attributes which need to be interfaced from Fusion to Cloud WMS through Oracle Integrated Cloud Service (OIC) to create items in WMS. The design document also covers the event attribute mappings from Fusion to Oracle Cloud WMS Functional Columns. ## Overview and Scope\n\nOverview\nFor performing transactions, item data is required in Cloud WMS System. Since items would be created directly in Fusion PDH and synchronization service will need to send the create/ update/ delete information to Cloud WMS. Business Purpose\nItems will be created in Oracle PDH; however, the warehouse activities will be carried out for all the manufacturing facilities (enabled as inventory organizations in WMS) using Cloud WMS. Hence, a specific interface needs to be built between Fusion and Cloud WMS as per the Business Requirement to keep item data in sync between the two systems. This design document focuses on building an interface between Fusion and Cloud WMS so that item data can be kept in sync. Scope\nThe scope of this document is limited to functional design of the interface to communicate items master data additions and updates from Fusion to Cloud WMS System. Functional Overview\nFusion Product Data Hub is a source for all item (product) information."

    "chunk": "As such, it is a master repository to hold all data, which is defined as a product by the Item number, Item description for the Inventory Organizations it is associated with. Product information are published to multiple consuming systems with their related entities for downstream consumption, as per configured publication criteria, to determine what data elements (Item Attributes) get published to what systems and at what cadence. Fusion Product Hub will publish only the products that meet the publication criteria in the PDH for the WMS downstream systems in respect of New Items and or Change order. All the items that need to be received and shipped out of the warehouses needs to be interfaced into the Item master in WMS. The PDH Item Master should include the following details at minimum:\n- Item Number\n- Item Description\n- Unit Length\n- Unit Width\n- Unit Height\n- Unit Weight\n- Unit Volume\nItem attribute tracked (Y/N) QC Required (Attribute)\nItem attribute Country of Origin\nItem Serial No tracked (Y/N)\nItem Expiry controlled tracked (Y/N) (If so product life & % Acceptable)\nItem batch no tracked (Y/N)\nVelocity Code (ABC classification)\nThe integration will be event-based with point-to-point integration. By integrating Fusion Product Master (including the required Org level items) to WMS, all the item\u2019s details, attributes and relationships, as listed above, are expected to be integrated into WMS, which will help in processing the inbound and outbound orders accurately. Outside PLM, Oracle Inventory Cloud (INV) will also be required to provide the ABC classifications for items to WMS. ABC classification is maintained at inventory organisation level. ABC classification will be added in EFF in item from where the integration will pick ABC classification and send it to WMS in the item field velocity code. # Business Objectives\n\nThe Product Hub (Item Master) maintains master item information enabling an enterprise to link all its critical item data to one source, providing a common point of reference. As part of the business process, items need to be published from Fusion Product Hub to the Warehouse Management System (WMS). The integration solution is designed to enable scalable integrations to accommodate future requirements."

This document describes the functional design of the list of attributes which need to be interfaced from Fusion to Cloud WMS through Oracle Integrated Cloud Service (OIC) to create suppliers in WMS. The design document also covers the event attribute mappings from Fusion to Oracle Cloud WMS Functional Columns. ## Overview and Scope\n\nOverview\nFor creating PO receipts, supplier data is required in Cloud WMS System. Since suppliers would be created directly in Fusion and synchronization service will need to send the create/ update information to Cloud WMS. Business Purpose\nAll Purchasing transactions will be recorded in Oracle Cloud ERP, however the warehouse activities will be carried out for all the manufacturing facilities (inventory organization enabled in WMS) using Cloud WMS. Both the systems need to communicate to complete the Receiving part of the Procure to Pay cycle for every single procurement transaction. Requisitions, Purchase orders will be primarily recorded in Oracle Procurement Cloud. Actual Receipts would be recorded in Cloud WMS upon receiving the Receipt Advice. However, to enable this receiving part of the procure to pay cycle, supplier data in Cloud WMS needs to be in sync with Fusion. WMS will be the material transaction system and Fusion will be the operational system (system of records). Hence, a specific interface needs to be built between Fusion and Cloud WMS as per the Business Requirement to keep Supplier data in sync between the two systems. This design document focuses on building an interface between Fusion and Cloud WMS so that Supplier data can be kept in sync."

A warehouse management system (or WMS) is a software application designed to support warehouse or distribution center management and staff. They facilitate management of available resources to move and store materials into, within, and out of a warehouse, while supporting staff in material movement and storage. Inventory Management Cloud supports a central integration framework across Oracle Procurement Cloud, Oracle Order Management Cloud, and Oracle Inventory Management based on web services to support the interactions between WMS and Fusion Cloud. ## Functional Overview\n\nFusion Inventory Management supports a central integration framework for working with warehouse management systems (WMS). The inventory management suite of products includes Fusion Receiving, Fusion Inventory Management, and Fusion Shipping. All the inventory adjustment transactions performed in WMS should be interfaced to Oracle inventory to update the on-hand quantities as well as track the transactions. The Functional Specifications described here below refers to the integration scenario of inventory adjustment performed in WMS."

Cycle count can be performed for both Reserve and Active locations. Cycle count can be done at LPN level (CC Location LPN Scan-Scan the location and each LPN in the location) Or at LPN Detail level (CC Location Content- Scan the location and each LPN in the location, followed by the SKU quantity) or Cycle Count Active Location (Scan the location-Scan SKU-Scan Item-Enter Quantity-Scan serial/lot).

A warehouse management system (or WMS) is a software application designed to support warehouse or distribution center management and staff. They facilitate management of available resources to move and store materials into, within, and out of a warehouse, while supporting staff in material movement and storage. Coordinating the communication with these systems to support purchase order receipts, returns to vendors, internal material transfers, inventory transactions, and sales order shipments is a substantial integration effort. Inventory Management Cloud supports a central integration framework across Oracle Procurement Cloud, Oracle Order Management Cloud, and Oracle Inventory Management based on web services to support the interactions between WMS and Fusion Cloud. Using these services, Inventory Management Cloud communicates Receipt Advice to Oracle Cloud WMS for processing. ## Functional Overview\n\nPurchase Orders are created and approved in Fusion Procurement, as soon they are approved, orders are interfaced to WMS by ESS job \u2018Generate Receipt Advice\u2019 Program. In WMS, Purchase Orders are referred during receiving process in WMS."

RMA Business Flow:\nThe above picture depicts the general steps in the Return Material Authorization (RMA) business flow. The steps initiate in Fusion Order Management with the creation of the RMA. This RMA is then interfaced to WMS via OIC integration to create an Inbound Shipment. In WMS the user receives the requested items and locates them into a put away location. The receipt information along with the put away are then interfaced back to Fusion to update the ASN and adjust the inventory stock quantities to reflect the received quantity. The Generate Receipt Advice from Inventory to WMS will push the RMAs to WMS for further execution in WMS. The details such as RMA (ASN) number, as item number, return quantity, return order, and return to warehouse etc. are get published to WMS. In WMS, warehouse employee is responsible in performing below operations:\n- Creation of Receipt\n- Put Away of material in specified return facility along with additional details of Locator/Serials/Lot if any. Once Put Away is performed in WMS, the item is physically returned into warehouse. An inventory person will now send receipt confirmation details (detailed put away material transaction) to Inventory and same is responsible in progressing the return sales order to Credit the [Anonymized Customer] or closure without credit. ## Process Overview\n\n- Create RMA in Fusion Order Management. - Schedule the process in Oracle Inventory Management \u201cGenerate Receipt Advice\u201d. The scheduled process Generate Receipt Advice publishes an event to notify the WMS that receipt advice is ready to be interfaced. The web service Send Receipt Advice provides the ability for the WMS to receive the actual receipt advice with the expected shipment lines for Return Material Authorization (RMAs). - After the WMS receives the receipt advice for RMA, an ASN gets created with details like [Anonymized Customer] Name, return quantity etc. from return order and performs receiving-related processes including receiving and put away."

The Generate Receipt Advice from Inventory to WMS will push the PO/ASN/RMA to WMS for further execution in WMS. The details such as PO number, supplier information, item number, item revision & quantity are published to WMS. In WMS, warehouse employee is responsible in performing below operations:\n- Creation of Receipt\n- Put Away of material in specified facility along with additional details of Locator/Serials/Lot if any. Direct delivery of the PRODUKTION stock will be performed to the lineside locations based on the puta way rules configured in WMS. The same information will be triggered to Fusion along with the locator updates. Since the PRODUKTION stock is only maintained in Fusion, the OIC will trigger an additional request to WMS to decrement the PRODUKTION stock in WMS after the put away transaction is completed. ## Process Overview\n\nThe Functional Specifications described here below refers to the integration scenario of Receipt Confirmation performed through an ASN which is outbound from WMS and inbound to SCM Cloud. The solution designed in this document is that allows to bring \u2018delivered\u2019 stock information from WMS to SCM Cloud application. The following is a high-level view of the most relevant information to be considered:\nFacility Code (Inventory Organization in SCM Cloud)\n[Anonymized Customer] Code (Business Unit in SCM Cloud)\nActivity code (Codes 1, 22,23,24, 25,4,49,2 and 51)\nItem code\nShipment Number (ASN, Advance Shipment Notice)\nPurchase Order Number\nRMA Number\nReceived Quantity\nLot/Batch Number\nSerial Number\nref_value_6 (Shipment Type)\nref_value_14 (VendorId)\nref_value_15 (VendorSiteId)\n\n# Mapping\n\n# Pre-Conditions\n\n- Suppliers should be interfaced to WMS from Fusion Procurement Cloud (INT002)\n- Purchase Order Type should be configured in WMS. - Shipment (ASN) Type should be configured in WMS. - Fusion sub inventories needs to be defined as lock code in WMS and should be assigned at location level. - PO in the fusion should be in approved status. - PO lines in the fusion should be in open status."

Business Flow:\nThe above picture depicts the process flow as per business requirement. The sales order is created and configured in Fusion Order Management. The Sales Order line(s) goes to GTM for trade screening once the order is successfully screened then manufacturing work order is created for the configured item(s). After completion of the Work order the Sales Order lines Wait for Shipment. At this moment an integration will trigger between Fusion Inv and WMS to interface the Sales Order lines to WMS. The above picture depicts the general steps in the Sales order business flow. The steps initiate in Fusion Order Management with the creation of a Sales Order. This sales order gets interfaced to WMS via OIC integration to create an Outbound Order. WMS allocates the order and ship it. The shipment details are then interfaced back to Fusion to update the shipment information, decrement the inventory quantities in stock and to update the sales order status. Each Shipping line will create a separate Order in WMS. The Sales Order Number column will reference the Fusion order with an additional sequence number except for the shipset orders. Shipset orders will have multiple order lines for the same order. The orders will be interfaced to WMS with a Delivery ID. The delivery ID is generated based on the shipping method, ship to country, scheduled ship date and the customer party site number. ## Process Overview\n\n- Create the Sales Order with the Configured item. - Sales Order lines reach to Awaiting Shipping. - Generate Shipment Request ESS job runs. - All the Sales Order lines which are not already interfaced will be interfaced to WMS (INT007.) - A new WMS Sales Order will be created based on the data provided by Fusion. # Pre-Conditions\n\n- Shipment line should not be already interfaced to WMS. - Shipment line should be in the Awaiting Shipping status."

A warehouse management system (or WMS) is a software application designed to support warehouse or distribution center management and staff. They facilitate management of available resources to move and store materials into, within, and out of a warehouse, while supporting staff in material movement and storage. Coordinating the communication with these systems to support purchase order receipts, returns to vendors, internal material transfers, inventory transactions, and sales order shipments is a substantial integration effort. Inventory Management Cloud supports a central integration framework across Oracle Procurement Cloud, Oracle Order Management Cloud, and Oracle Inventory Management based on web services to support the interactions between WMS and Fusion Cloud. Using these services, Inventory Management Cloud communicates Sales Order shipment request to Oracle Cloud WMS for processing. ## Functional Overview\n\n[Anonymized Customer] business process flow requires WMS to send the Shipment Confirmation notification to Oracle Fusion on successfully shipping the sales order in WMS. On receiving the request Shipment Lines of the Sales Order in Fusion should get marked as Shipped to complete the fulfillment process in Fusion. This integration will run as in when an order is shipped in WMS."

    "chunk": "Sales order or transfer order documents are created in Oracle fusion cloud. Order orchestration steps take the orders to awaiting shipping and then order will be eligible to interface to WMS cloud. The delivery ID is generated based on the customer ship to name, ship to country, scheduled ship date and the customer party site number. Order will be interfaced to WMS and Delivery Id will be a sent as Externally planned load number on the WMS Order lines. Orders will be waved for allocation and task creation. Task will be performed and pick pack will be completed. Load will be shipped from WMS Cloud. This will interface the shipping details to Fusion Inventory cloud to ship confirm the delivery. # Business Objectives\n\nWhen integrating Oracle Warehouse Management system (or WMS) with Oracle Inventory Management Cloud, there is a requirement to send the Ship Confirmation request of WMS to Fusion Oracle Inventory Management so that Sales Order lines in fusion can be marked as Shipped. Business Flow:\nThe above picture depicts the process flow as per business requirement. Fusion sales order is interfaced to WMS and a new Sales Order is created in WMS. This sales order will further get Pick, Pack and Ship in WMS. Once a sales order is shipped, Shipment Confirmation integration will be triggered from WMS to Oracle Fusion to notify the Fusion system that the sales order is shipped. On receiving the Shipment Confirmation request from WMS, Sales Order line status will be changed from Awaiting Shipping to Shipped to mark the end of fulfillment. The above picture depicts the general steps in the Sales order business flow. The steps initiate in Fusion Order Management with the creation of a Sales Order. This sales order gets interfaced to WMS via OIC integration to create an Outbound Order. WMS allocates the order and ship it. The shipment details are then interfaced back to Fusion to update the shipment information, decrement the inventory quantities in stock and to update the sales order status. ## Process Overview\n\n- The scheduled process Generate Shipment Request enables inventory management users to send shipment lines to the WMS using the task Create Outbound Shipment request using a scheduled process. - Delivery Id will be created by grouping the order by customer, ship to address and schedule ship date. Order will be interfaced to WMS and Delivery Id will be a sent as External plan load number on the WMS Order lines."

In case of the ship method change other than what is there on the sales order, it can be updated by changing ship method on carrier field on Obload screen. - Load will be shipped from WMS Cloud. The Receive Shipment Confirmation is new web service when initiated with the required input, receives and processes the shipment confirmation messages. This service interprets and transforms the message and creates the necessary records in the shipping open interface tables. This transformation provides the mechanism for the WMS to send the material and shipping details for the shipment lines fulfilled. - The scheduled process Perform Shipping Transactions processes the pending transaction records received into the open interface tables. The process validates the data on the transaction records received from the WMS before processing them. Any errors from the validation step are recorded, and the transaction records remain in the open interface tables. The interface records with errors are available for users to view, edit, or resolve the errors, or reprocess.

A warehouse management system (or WMS) is a software application designed to support warehouse or distribution center management and staff. They facilitate management of available resources to move and store materials into, within, and out of a warehouse, while supporting staff in material movement and storage. Coordinating the communication with these systems to support purchase order receipts, returns to vendors, internal material transfers, inventory transactions, and sales order shipments is a substantial integration effort. Inventory Management Cloud supports a central integration framework across Oracle Procurement Cloud, Oracle Order Management Cloud, and Oracle Inventory Management based on web services to support the interactions between WMS and Fusion Cloud. Using these services, Inventory Management Cloud communicates Sales Order changes to Oracle Cloud WMS for processing. ## Functional Overview\n\n[Anonymized Customer] business process flow requires the Change Order to be initiated in Order Management system to facilitate the amendments to the sales order and then the corresponding changes should be performed in WMS system. Once change order is initiated, the integration will first check if the shipment line is already interfaced to WMS or not."

    "chunk": "If it\u2019s already interfaced, following steps would be executed via integration:\n- Lock the corresponding sales order WMS via integration. - Perform the changes to the sales order in Fusion. - Perform corresponding changes to sales order in WMS via integration. - Unlock the corresponding sales order in WMS via integration. If the shipment line is not already interfaced, the integration will skip the shipment line for processing. # Business Objectives\n\nWhen integrating Oracle Inventory Management Cloud with a warehouse management system (or WMS), there is the requirement to send the sales order changes in Fusion to WMS so that corresponding changes can be performed in WMS system. Business Flow:\nThe above picture depicts the process flow as per business requirement. The steps initiate in Fusion Order Management with the creation of the sales order in Fusion order management. This shipment line is interfaced to WMS via shipment request job and corresponding sales order is created in WMS. Based on business need, sales order cancellation/update is initiated in Fusion. The corresponding transaction in WMS is validated if it\u2019s not allocated or picked. If it\u2019s not allocated or picked in WMS, then the corresponding sales order line in fusion is locked. As part of synchronous interface from Fusion to WMS, number lock is applied to corresponding line in WMS. Then the fusion order line is updated. Once changes are completed in Fusion, the corresponding WMS line is updated via synchronous interface from Fusion to WMS. Thereafter, order line in fusion is unlocked. This will trigger unlock operation in WMS line via synchronous integration. This will complete the change order process. ## Process Overview\n\n- Initiate change order process in Fusion Order Management. - Validate the sales order in WMS if it\u2019s not allocated or picked. - Apply lock to the fusion order. - Apply lock to the corresponding WMS order via integration (INT023)\n- Perform changes to sales order in Fusion. - Perform changes (updates) to order in WMS via integration (INT022)\n- Unlock order in Fusion. - Unlock order in WMS via integration (INT023)\n\n# Pre-Conditions\n\n- Shipment line should be interfaced from Fusion to WMS\n- Line in WMS should not be allocated or picked."

This document describes the functional design of the list of attributes which need to be interfaced from Fusion to Cloud WMS through Oracle Integrated Cloud Service (OIC) to create RTV Outbound Order in WMS. The design document also covers the event attribute mappings from Fusion to Oracle Cloud WMS Functional Columns. ## Overview and Scope\n\nOverview\nAll RTV transactions will be recorded first in Fusion. The fields required by Oracle Cloud WMS to carry out the transaction as an Outbound Order shall be queried from Fusion and passed on to OIC wherein the data shall be transformed and mapped to the Sales Order Shipment Outbound Integration from Fusion to Oracle Cloud WMS. This transformed data shall then be sent to WMS to process the RTV transaction as a sales order shipment. The Sales order will be created within WMS with an order type specifically configured for (and as) \u201cRTV\u201d. The sales order would then be waved, picked, packed, and shipped within Oracle Cloud WMS. However, the Shipment Confirmation for such Sales Orders with Order Type \u201cReturn to Vendor\u201d will not be sent back to Fusion. Return to Vendor (RTV) transactions will be primarily recorded in Fusion but sent to WMS to adjust the inventory in WMS so, that both the systems are in perfect synchronization. Returns would be created using a 1-way communication from Fusion to Cloud WMS."

The design document also covers the event attribute mappings from Fusion to Oracle Cloud WMS Functional Columns. ## Overview and Scope\n\nOverview\nMovement requests are requests for the movement of material within an inventory organization such as a warehouse or facility. These types of movement requests exist:\n- Replenishment movement requests\n- Shop floor movement requests\nBusiness Purpose\nMovement Request transaction enables to perform the complete process required to request movement of material, physically move material, and confirm physical movement of material. Hence, a specific interface needs to be built between Fusion and Cloud WMS as per the Business Requirement to keep movement request intact between the two systems. This design document focuses on building an interface between Fusion and Cloud WMS so that movement requests are performed without any issues. Scope\nThe scope of this document is limited to functional design of the interface movement requests from Fusion to Cloud WMS System. Functional Overview\nFusion Movement Request is a source for all movement requests published to WMS. These movement requests will be interfaced to WMS for different use cases. - Min-Max replenishment process in Fusion will trigger a movement request in WMS to move material to PRODUKTION lineside locations from respective Storage Subinventory specified as part of Min Max Setup at Subinventory Level."
