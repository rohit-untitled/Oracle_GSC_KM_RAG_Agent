# Introduction

## Purpose

This Design Specification documents the detailed design for items Interface from Fusion to Oracle Cloud WMS.
This document describes the functional design of the list of attributes which need to be interfaced from Fusion to Cloud WMS through Oracle Integrated Cloud Service (OIC) to create items in WMS. The design document also covers the event attribute mappings from Fusion to Oracle Cloud WMS Functional Columns.

## Overview and Scope

Overview
For performing transactions, item data is required in Cloud WMS System. Since items would be created directly in Fusion PDH and synchronization service will need to send the create/ update/ delete information to Cloud WMS.
Business Purpose
Items will be created in Oracle PDH; however, the warehouse activities will be carried out for all the manufacturing facilities (enabled as inventory organizations in WMS) using Cloud WMS. Hence, a specific interface needs to be built between Fusion and Cloud WMS as per the Business Requirement to keep item data in sync between the two systems.
This design document focuses on building an interface between Fusion and Cloud WMS so that item data can be kept in sync.
Scope
The scope of this document is limited to functional design of the interface to communicate items master data additions and updates from Fusion to Cloud WMS System.
Functional Overview
Fusion Product Data Hub is a source for all item (product) information. As such, it is a master repository to hold all data, which is defined as a product by the Item number, Item description for the Inventory Organizations it is associated with.
Product information are published to multiple consuming systems with their related entities for downstream consumption, as per configured publication criteria, to determine what data elements (Item Attributes) get published to what systems and at what cadence.
Fusion Product Hub will publish only the products that meet the publication criteria in the PDH for the WMS downstream systems in respect of New Items and or Change order.
All the items that need to be received and shipped out of the warehouses needs to be interfaced into the Item master in WMS.  The PDH Item Master should include the following details at minimum:
- Item Number
- Item Description
- Unit Length
- Unit Width
- Unit Height
- Unit Weight
- Unit Volume
Item attribute tracked (Y/N) QC Required (Attribute)
Item attribute Country of Origin
Item Serial No tracked (Y/N)
Item Expiry controlled tracked (Y/N) (If so product life & % Acceptable)
Item batch no tracked (Y/N)
Velocity Code (ABC classification)
The integration will be event-based with point-to-point integration.
By integrating Fusion Product Master (including the required Org level items) to WMS, all the item’s details, attributes and relationships, as listed above, are expected to be integrated into WMS, which will help in processing the inbound and outbound orders accurately. Outside PLM, Oracle Inventory Cloud (INV) will also be required to provide the ABC classifications for items to WMS.  ABC classification is maintained at inventory organisation level. ABC classification will be added in EFF in item from where the integration will pick ABC classification and send it to WMS in the item field velocity code.

# Business Objectives

The Product Hub (Item Master) maintains master item information enabling an enterprise to link all its critical item data to one source, providing a common point of reference.
As part of the business process, items need to be published from Fusion Product Hub to the Warehouse Management System (WMS).
The integration solution is designed to enable scalable integrations to accommodate future requirements.
The following objectives were captured during the Focus Stage and are addressed by the functional designs described in this document:

---
**Table:**

| Requirement ID | Category | Short description |
| INT001 | Product master to Item Master in WMS | This interface will publish item core data for Warehouse Management System (WMS) downstream systems. |

---

## Process Overview

# Mapping

# Pre-Conditions

- The Product Hub (Item Master) and destination systems (WMS) should already contain synchronised and aligned item masters as a part of the Item Master data migration.
- Configured publication criteria for WMS downstream systems are in place.
- Organizations against which items are created should exist in WMS.
- The item interface triggers on assignment of an item to an inventory organization (the same inventory organization should be WMS enabled)

# Risk Matrix

---
**Table:**

| Risk | Impact  (1 to 5) | Probability (1 to 5) | Mitigation |
| PO/ASN/RMA/SO/TO Interface Failure to WMS due to missing item in WMS | 5 | 2 | Valid error message stating the integration failure. Re-run the item integration |
| FG Creation and WIP returns stock creation failure in WMS due to missing item in WMS | 5 | 2 | Valid error message stating the integration failure. Re-run the item integration |

### Assumptions

- Mapping between Inventory Organizations in SCM Cloud and WMS Facilities needs to be setup for this integration to extract data.
- The integration excludes the possibility to delete an item from WMS Cloud. It only covers create operation.
- In case, if no records are extracted during the current schedule period. The integration will end normal.
- In case of any success/error in the integration, a notification email will be sent to the mail list configured in the OIC lookup.
- Items created and associated to Org level of WMS Enabled sites only should be passed to WMS Environment.
- Items populated with PutAway Type, QC Required, Country of Origin in Fusion will be interfaced to WMS.

### High Level Approach

- The Item bulk Export “XxPublishItemsErpToWms” integration will be a scheduled integration which will trigger the custom ESS job “Xx_INT001_ITEMS_EXTRACT_ESS_JOB”, it is scheduled to run once in day.
- Item details are extracted from SCM Cloud (SaaS) using the BI Publisher tool.
- The extracted Item records data file is placed in UCM.
- The extracted Item information will be interfaced to WMS cloud using WMS “InitStageInterfaceAPI” service.

### Pre-Requisites

Send Email Integration “XxCommonNotificationHandler” should be deployed in the OIC.
Lookup “XXDominoCommonLookup” should be present with all the required details regarding success/error email notify flag, success and error notify ToEmail Address in OIC.
Lookup “XxDominoConstantLookup” should be present with all the required details regarding success and error notify FromEmail Address in OIC.
Lookup “XXDominoWmsCompanyLookup” should be present to transform Fusion BU with WMS Company Code.
